Thank you for taking a look at my github!
My name is Leo.
I am interested in making the world better for us and the generations that will follow us.
This places me in direct opposition to those who would eke out every resource possible from the people and environment of this planet.
I would like to work on projects that can be used to better the world, or at least make our lives as a community more liveable.
